You can use the `grep` command with the `-n` option to search for a specified word in a file and display the line numbers with matching results. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the correct number of arguments is provided
if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <word> <file>"
    exit 1
fi

# Store the word and file name
word="$1"
file="$2"

# Search for the word in the file and display line numbers with matching results
grep -n "$word" "$file"
```

Save this script to a file (e.g., `search_word.sh`), make it executable (`chmod +x search_word.sh`), and then run it with the word you want to search for and the name of the file you want to search in:

```bash
./search_word.sh search_word.txt
```

Replace `search_word.txt` with the actual file name you want to search in.

This script will display the line numbers along with the lines that contain the specified word in the specified file using the `grep` command with the `-n` option.
